Gameodoro is a Flutter app that combines the concept of Pomodoro and Game. It helps users manage their time and stay focused while working on tasks. Classic games are provided in the app so you don't get distracted anywhere else (the games will be paused when during focus session).

## Features

- Pomodoro timer with customizable work and break intervals
- Task management with the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks
- Games: Tetris and Snake

## Limitations

- Due to lack of motivation, only Android is fully supported for now.
- MacOS is also supported with unfixed UI bugs.
- Only vertical size is supported for now
